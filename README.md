# Webscraping-from-Understat
This repository is the first part of several projects where the output will be advanced dashboard(s) and models predicting different football matches in the 2022/23 season in Europes top 5 leagues. This will work as the data source for my project.
I have been greatly inspired by @McKayJohns who has provided great turtorials on how to conduct data analysis for several sports. 

Furthermore, you can find two different files (python scripts) conducted in JupyterNotebook, containing rawdata on team stats and player stats. This rawdata will further be aggregated, summarized etc in an ETL process and then stored in a database. 
You can find the whole process and end-result in my other repository https://github.com/Amir-Analytics/ProjectPortfolio.git
